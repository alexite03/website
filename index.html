        <h1> THIS IS A GUIDE AIMED</h1>
        <p> Say, you want to make som music, right. You know your basic melodies, your Dur and Mol chords, but you want to take a step further. You want to digitalize your tunes, but are unsure on how to pull off such an unimaginable feat. This guide was specifically made for people like you who have no idea what a DAW is yet want to arrange something. That's why I'll be cutting the BS and get straight to the point when I'm trying to make a point, and we're going to use FL Studio to achieve this - the music making I mean.</p>
