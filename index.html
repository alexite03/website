        <h1> A MEDIOCRE STARTERGUIDE FOR FRUITYLOOPS</h1>
        <p> Say, you want to make som music, right. You know your basic melodies, your Dur and Mol chords, but you want
            to take a step further. You want to digitalize your tunes, but are unsure on how to pull off such an
            unimaginable feat. This guide was specifically made for people like you who have no idea what a DAW is yet
            want to arrange something. That's why I'll be cutting the BS and get straight to the point when I'm trying
            to make a point, and we're going to use FL Studio to achieve this - the music making I mean.</p>
        <h2><a id="HowDoIGetFLStudio">How do I get FL Studio? </a></h2>
        <p> FL Studio is free, and can be downloaded through Image-Line's website. Naturally, you couldn't be arsed to go get it yourself, so I've prepared a link for you by myself right <a href="https://www.image-line.com/downloads/flstudiodownload.html?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=42694613f2f40e41698683c9fe67768dabc7bd5f-1591018275-0-AWURhZV2SjqT-tvN88MCAmO4sqYMsqAgLO1YJKn3q5i-wFoGzhJePYL5idlDUQjJkk1nfsxlgAt8hfsx9W6UfIlQyK1VpcCK5_9RflIy1ScKVpdY6Zw-myqd6l_cSDZ4HExQsH60NfkgacHld-SJQ3Z_HaBPg6eBx25OYL-lDZ65kSjgAlSscm8o0jmIY8Er_tfnrgrEfSiAfbC8ZbJgtg_37AUDcVeBWw2Lbt7SDIDaYGkjAZ0aKjBms1YZrfmQPMQLEsmjVs8pkbV2jvMIX5Ug1FNsW6uUmspVkwKdQ9bUij3oZle6lz2MbK2Qkoq7rA" target="_blank">here.</a> Keep in mind that you can't load up songs with the free version, however that should be the least of your concerns regarding the fact that you don't even know how to use this DAW yet!</p>
        <h2><a id="Startup">Startup </a></h2>
        <p>Make sure you install the DAW with the preffered attributes. When you start FL Studio up, you should get something like this:</p>
